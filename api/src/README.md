1. make a README that shows what types and relationships are in each folder, using a bullet point list that matches the directory structure, then making the type names permalinks to the schema line number at which that type starts, for every motherfucking type.

1. make a game plan for moving forward, ill link to their issues for data sources that they link out to from their zen board thing, using their github issue tags
   I'll ping those in schema update issues, and we track in those any changes or additions to corresponding GraphQL schema there maybe


1. finish relationship types 
2. run through all fields with a freshly generated schema from the typescript starter script
3. 





1. link to grandstack docs in the various schema for showing stuff about things
1. comment above relationship fields, the path to the schema that contains the type
