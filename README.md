This project serves to develop and maintain a [Neo4j-GraphQL](https://grandstack.io/docs/neo4j-graphql-js) API for the Neo4j graph database used by the [CovidGraph](https://covidgraph.org/) project. 

[![Image from covidgraph.org](https://covidgraph.org/img/content-img/Schema_v1.1_no_logo.png)](https://covidgraph.org/ 'Image from covidgraph.org')

## Demo
The API is currently hosted by Vercel at: https://covid-graph-graphql.now.sh/. For example queries, please see the below [integration tests](#tests).

Try this query ðŸš€
```graphql
query {
  Paper(first: 50) {
    _hash_id
    cord_uid
    journal
    publish_time
    source
    title
    url
  }
}
```

## Getting Started
Install root dependencies: 
```sh
npm install
```
and install `/api` dependencies:
```sh
cd api
npm install
```
In the root directory, you can start the API server with: 
```sh
run run start
```
To develop the API server and print Cypher translations to your terminal:
```sh
cd api
npm run start:dev
```

## Tests
Integration tests are run using [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava). To run the below tests, start the API server and run:
```sh
npm run test
```
If you're in `/api`, you can run: 
```sh
npm run integration
```
